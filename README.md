# RealGraphPlus
## EXPERIMENTS
  
In this section, we validate the effectiveness of RealGraph+ by answering the following evaluation questions (EQs):  
 - EQ1[^eq1]: Are our optimization strategies effective in improving the performance of RealGraph+?  
 - EQ2[^eq1]: How much does RealGraph+ improve the original RealGraph in terms of the IO-BW/exec. time in graph processing?  
 - EQ3[^eq3]: Does RealGraph+ provide the performance better than state-of-the-art single-machine-based graph engines?  
 - EQ4[^eq4]: Does RealGraph+ provide the performance better than state-of-the-art distributed-system-based graph engines?
